### to run the python code:
### type the following command in terminal: python3 script.py
After running the python code named script.py we will get six different text files for each benchmark in the folder. 
For an instance, for tcas six .txt files will be generated, named as: random_branch_suite.txt, random_statement_suite.txt, total_branch_suite.txt, total_statement_suite.txt, additional_branch_suite.txt, additional_statement_suite.txt
### to detect the fault:
### Type the following command in terminal to run the code: python3 faultDetect.py arguments
to detect the faults in each benchmark we have to mention the name of the benchmark name in place of arguments, for example to detect faults in tcas we have to type in the commandline: python3 faultDetect.py tcas
After running the faultDetect.py for each benchmark, six new .txt files will be generated. For example, in tcas random-branch-suite-FaultReport.txt, random-statement-suite-FaultReport.txt, total-branch-suite-FaultReport.txt, total-statement-suite-FaultReport.txt, additional-branch-suite-FaultReport.txt, additional-statement-suite-FaultReport.txt will be generated.
